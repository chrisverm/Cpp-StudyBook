<h1>Two's Complement</h1>
<p>Two's complement is a mathmatical operation performed on binary numbers that allows modern computers to store negative numbers. It involves taking the binary representation of an integer, flipping each of the bits, and then adding 1. Simple as that.</p>
<p>Here is an example :</p>
<code class="block">
// this is the binary representation of 60 in 8 bits
	
// as stated before, to get -60 we first flip each of the bits
	
// and then we add 1, and we have -60 in binary, found using two's complement
</code>
<p>Generally, when computers store signed integers (integers able to be positive or negative) it will assign the bit of greatest value to be the "sign bit" - a 0 for positive or a 1 for negative.</p>
